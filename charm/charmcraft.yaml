title: OpenAPI REST Proxy
summary: OpenAPI REST Proxy helps you wrap another OpenAPI conformant RESTful API with transparent auth.

description: |
  OpenAPI REST Proxy allows you to easily create a RESTful API based on an OpenAPI specification,
  filtering through a selection of allowed endpoints.

  It optionally transparently handles auth with OAuth client credentials flow, and can be configured to pass arbitrary fixed request headers to the proxied service it makes calls to.
